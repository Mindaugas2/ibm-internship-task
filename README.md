### Step 1. Clone the repository
The repository should cloned using this command `git clone https://github.com/Mindaugas2/ibm-internship-task.git` to your desired directory.

### Step 2. Install the project's packages
The application utilizes various NPM packages. To use the packet manager, Node.js has to be installed on your system.

To find out whether it is already in your system, run `node -v` in a terminal window (I use the LTS v16.17.0 version).

If all is fine, navigate to the project folder you cloned earlier and open the `frontend` folder. Bring up a terminal window here and run `npm install`. This will populate the project with all the necessary dependencies.

### Step 3. Run it
Once the dependencies are all set, you are free to try out the application. Use the `npm start` command to run it. By default, it should run on port 3000. That is, the link to it would be `http://localhost:3000`.
